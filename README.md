# 2048

Training a Reinforcement Learning agent using DQN. 

## Notebook

The notebook 2048_DQN.ipynb contains the code for the training of the agent, as well as testing and metric evaluation. 

## Report

The report describing the project is in the file 2048_RL_Report.pdf

## Parameter files

3 different rewards were used for training the DQN, so there are 3 different parameter sets of the network. The parameters are in the .dms files.

## Python files

The python files provide the opportunity to display a specific game played by one of the 3 agents considered. Put all the files (3 .dms files included) in the same project, and run the main.py file (you can change the reward parameter to change the considered reward).
